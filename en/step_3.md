## Flappy Astronaut

While the astronauts on the ISS are kept pretty busy, every now and then they still need to have a few minutes of relaxation. There are two Raspberry Pis with Sense HATs up there with them, so a little game of Flappy Astronaut would be the perfect way for an astronaut to unwind after a hard day's work in zero gravity.
