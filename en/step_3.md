## Flappy Astronaut

While astronauts are kept pretty busy while on the ISS, they still need to grab a few minutes of relaxation time every now and then. There are two Raspberry Pis with Sense HATs up there with them, so a little game of Flappy Astronaut would be the perfect way to unwind after a hard day's work in zero gravity.
