## What you will make
In this activity you will create a Flappy Bird clone using your Raspberry Pi, a Sense HAT, and some Python code. In your Flappy Astronaut game the player uses the Sense HAT joystick to navigate an astronaut around pipes.

## What you will learn
By making a Flappy Astronaut game with your Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT, you will learn how to:

- Light up Sense HAT LEDs
- Use the Sense HAT joystick
- Use 2D lists to represent a screen

Click on the arrow in the emulation below to play the game. Use your cursor keys to guide your astronaut around the pipes.
