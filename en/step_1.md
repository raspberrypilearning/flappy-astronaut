## What you will make
In this activity you will create a Flappy Bird clone using your Raspberry Pi and a Sense HAT, along with some Python code. Flappy Astronaut uses the accelerometer in the Sense HAT to control the astronaut, by shaking the Raspberry Pi.

## What you will learn
By coding a Flappy Astronaut game with your Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT, you will learn:

- How to illuminate Sense HAT pixels
- How to capture data from the accelerometer
- How to use multiple threads to have non-blocking funtions

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Apply abstraction and decomposition to solve more complex problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/developer)
- [Use basic digital, analogue, and electromechanical components](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/creator)
