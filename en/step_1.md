## What you will make
In this activity you will create a Flappy Bird clone using your Raspberry Pi and a Sense HAT, along with some Python code. Flappy Astronaut uses the joystick in the Sense HAT to control the astronaut.

Use the cursor keys to navigate your astronaut around the pipes.

## What you will learn
By coding a Flappy Astronaut game with your Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT, you will learn:

- How to illuminate Sense HAT pixels
- How to use the Sense HAT joystick
- How to use 2D lists to represent a screen.
