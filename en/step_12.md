## Adding your astronaut

- In this game your astronaut will be represented by a single coloured pixel. Th choice of colours is yours, but the examples will use yellow. Where you have set your other colour constants, now create a new tuple for your chosen colour.

	```python
	RED = (255, 0, 0)
	BLUE = (0, 0, 255)
	YELLOW = (255, 255, 0)
	```

- As the astronaut is going to be a single pixel, she'll need an `x` and a `y` coordinate, so that that pixel can be illuminated.
