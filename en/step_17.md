## Challenge: taking it further

Here are some ideas for how you could alter your game:
- The for loop alters the spacing between the pipes. Try changing it to see if that makes the game trickier.
- Alter the `sleep` function to make the pipes move faster.
- Add a score, so that for each for loop passed the score increases by 1. Then display the score when the game ends.
- Try making the game a little more like Flappy Bird. Can you make it so that the astronaut constantly falls, but flicking the joystick causes her to move upwards.
