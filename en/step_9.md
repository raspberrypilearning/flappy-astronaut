## Moving pipes algorithm

Now that you can generate as many pipes as you want, you need to move them across the matrix so that they proceed towards the left of the screen.

It might be easier to picture this on a smaller scale. For instance, here's a 5Ã—5 matrix:

	```
	  0 1 2 3 4
	0 b b b b r
	1 b b b b r
	2 b b b b b
	3 b b b b r
	4 b b b b r
	```
To move the red pixels (`r`) to the left, you can follow a simple algorithm:
  1. Move all the items at index `1` in each of the rows to index `0`
  1. Move all the items at index `2` in each of the tows to index `1`
  1. Move all the items at index `3` in each of the tows to index `2`
  1. Move all the items at index `4` in each of the tows to index `3`
  1. Fill all the items at index `5` in each row with a `b`

This would then give you a matrix that looks like this:

	```
	  0 1 2 3 4
	0 b b b r b
	1 b b b r b
	2 b b b b b
	3 b b b r b
	4 b b b r b
	```
You could then run the algorithm again to repeat the movement. which would give you this:

	```
	  0 1 2 3 4
	0 b b r b b
	1 b b r b g
	2 b b b b b
	3 b b r b b
	4 b b r b b
	```
If you did this with your matrix, then the following would happen.
