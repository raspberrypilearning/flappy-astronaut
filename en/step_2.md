## What you will need

### Hardware
If you are not using an emulator you will need the following hardware:
+ Raspberry Pi
+ Sense HAT
If you are using an emulator then you simply require a computer with access to https://trinket.io/.

### Software
You will need the [latest version of Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/), which already includes the following software packages:

- Python 3
- Sense HAT for Python 3

If for any reason you need to install a package manually, follow these instructions:

[[[rpi-install-software]]]

Type this command into a terminal window to install the Sense HAT package:

```bash
sudo apt-get install sense-hat
```
